# suparnatural-graphql-plugin

A Kotlin Multiplatform gradle plugin which generates type safe classes from a GraphQl schema and operations.
The generated classes are serialized using [kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization)
framework. Currently, the plugin is tested with `JVM`, `android` and `iOS`.
