<p>A ReadWrite lock allows multiple readers to read a value
and only one writer to update it. A read lock cannot be obtained until
write lock is released. A write lock cannot be obtained until current
readers don't release read lock.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<pre><code>val lock = ReadWriteLock()

// read from multiple threads simultaneously.
lock.acquireReadLock() // call from as many threads

// perform read ....

lock.releaseReadLock()

// to protect writes
lock.acquireWriteLock() // only one thread will get lock, others will be blocked.

// perform write ....

lock.releaseWriteLock() // next thread will now unblock.
